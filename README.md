# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
A web-based dashboard built for users who want to view the five day forecast for any city of their choosing. The user can input a city into the search bar and the openweather API should fetch the forecast for that respective city.  

The API data will be projected into five slots that each represent one of the five days of the forecast pulled from the API.
